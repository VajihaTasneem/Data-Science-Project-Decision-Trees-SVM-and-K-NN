Data Science Project: Decision Trees, SVM, and K-NN
• Implemented machine learning algorithms (Decision Trees, k-NN, SVMs) to classify beans accurately using visual data.
• Fine-tuned models and rigorously evaluated performance metrics (accuracy, precision, recall) through cross-validation.
• Demonstrated expertise in machine learning model building, evaluation, and optimization using Python libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn.
